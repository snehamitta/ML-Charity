#ML Charity

In this project, I have applied supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. 

Exploration of the data was done to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques was implemented to manipulate the data into a workable format. 

The classifier used was AdaBoostClassifier. Parameter Optimization was done using the GridSearch method.

The Accuracy on the test set of the optimized model is: 0.8632
The AUC on test set of the optimized model is: 0.7884
